# WeatherApp
Weather App following standard practices, standard App Architecture.

I am creating this app as part of my learning process. I have created some apps earlier. In this app I am taking care of the standard practices while making the app by-

# Focus Points
                 -Taking care of the Activity Lifecycle
                 -Using RecyclerView for dynamically showing data.
                 -Creating a Data Model
                 -Using Repositories
                 -LiveData
                 -MVVM App Architecture
                 -Using XML still for layout files (Probably will refactor into Android Jetpack,
                 Now don't want to increase the load)

# Creating a layout file using XML
               -created a proper layout file Activity_main.xml which has an ImageView for location icon,
               A textView to instruct to enter Zip code, an EditText to take User Input, and a button to
               act to show required output.


# Some General set ups
              -Layout file for MainActivity is inflated.
              -Onclick listener is set up
# Data Model and Repositories
# Data Model
    -This is a data class for modelling our data coming from repository which either loads data from network or local database.
    -We crerated a data class called DailyForcast
# Repository 
    -We have defined ForecastRepository.kt for Repository.
    -Our repository does 2 things: PART B. load data and model into data class.
                                   PART A. Provides data to our activity.
                                   
    -PART B. For loading data and modeling it into the Data class;
          - we are using a method to generate random temperature value for 7 days: loadForecast 
          which generates random tem value in a list called randomTemperature.
          -Later we are Mapping this list of temperatures to DailyForecast data class, with description string, 
           using map collection method. map returns a list of type DailyForecast which is referred by the variable forecastItems.
    -PART A. To provide data to our activity we are setting up LiveData; 1 mutableLiveData and 1 immutable LiveData
             which is being set by the loadForecast()
            - After setting up LiveData in loadForecast, we need to set up observe() and Observer(optional, an anonymous class object for
              Observer can be passed in to the observe method directly). These has to be used by the LiveData.
    
    Q LiveData deprecated? 
# Week 3 Summary
      -We implemented a a recycler view, An adapter using ListAdapter, ViewHolder and layout for binding data item with viewholder,.
      -We efficiently binded the data item wih the viewholder and implemented a clickhandler too.
      -we added a function getTempDescription() to get customized description about the temperature.

# Week 4 Intents, Menu/dialogues, shared preferences and multiple activity
       This week we will;
       -create a new Activity ForecastDetailsActivity
       -Using an intent we will pass 'clicked forecast data' to ForecastDetails Activity and display it.
       -Create a menu with single item to control our temp display units.
       -Show an alert dialogue when settings item is clicked to select display setting.
       -Save data for setting using SharedPreferences out of different options we have for saving data. 
        To save data we can use Databases, Files or Sharedpreferences.
                      Databases: it supports large, complex quesries.
                      Files:   It is generally used to save media files and documents.
                               it can also be used to save data for settings or data to be used by our apps.
                      SharedPreferences: for saving simple data, like settings.
                      
       -Update UI formatting based on selected setting.
       
       links for note on Intent: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEfZFK6OGns-hRqKRs-6FinxzwFDWqNhNq34sCZcOYo/edit
       
       - Created a new package called details.
       - added a new Activity called ForecastDetailsActivity.kt in it
       - added an Explicit intent inside the clickHandler method(An anonymous class which is being passed as an arguement) of DailyForecastAdapter

       - Added a passForecastDetailsUsingIntent() method for the purpose of making an intent instance in order to navigate to 
       ForecastDetailsActivity 
                    - here we are creating an instance of intent.
                    - with intent we are adding some data which will travel with the intent using putExtra()
                    - in ForecastDetailsActivity class we can access the data travelling with intent instance using intent.getFloatExtra 
                    or getIntent.getFloatExtra()
       - we craeted a kotlin file called ForecastUtils in which we created a method called formatTempForDisplay() to create right format for 
       temperature value. It can be used across the project to create format for temp.

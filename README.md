# I am creating this app as part of my learning process. I have created some apps earlier. In this app I am taking care of the standard practices while making the app by-
                 -Taking care of the Activity Lifecycle
                 -Using RecyclerView for dynamically showing data.
                 -Creating a Data Model
                 -Using Repositories
                 -LiveData
                 -MVVM App Architecture

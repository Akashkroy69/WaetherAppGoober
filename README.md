I am creating this app as part of my learning process. I have created some apps earlier. In this app I am taking care of the standard practices while making the app by-

-Taking care of the Activity Lifecycle
-Using RecyclerView for dynamically showing data.
-Creating a Data Model
-Using Repositories
-MVVM App Architecture

# WeatherApp
Weather App following standard practices

I am creating this app as part of my learning process. I have created some apps earlier. In this app I am taking care of the standard practices while making the app by-

# Focus Points
                 -Taking care of the Activity Lifecycle
                 -Using RecyclerView for dynamically showing data.
                 -Creating a Data Model
                 -Using Repositories
                 -LiveData
                 -MVVM App Architecture
                 -Using XML still for layout files (Probably will refactor into Android Jetpack,
                 Now don't want to increase the load)

# Creating a layout file using XML
               -created a proper layout file Activity_main.xml which has an ImageView for location icon,
               A textView to instruct to enter Zip code, an EditText to take User Input, and a button to
               act to show required output.
